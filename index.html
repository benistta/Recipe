        A chocolate chip cookie is a sweet baked treat that is recognized by its
        butter flavor and the inclusion of chocolate chips. Some variations can
        include nuts, oatmeal or raisins as well.

        How to Make:
      </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Sift flours, baking soda, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Set
          aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using a mixer fitted with paddle attachment, cream butter and sugars
          together until very light, about 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time,
          mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Reduce speed to
          low, add dry ingredients and mix until just combined, 5 to 10 seconds.
          Drop chocolate pieces in and incorporate them without breaking them.
          Press plastic wrap against dough and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours.
          Dough may be used in batches, and can be refrigerated for up to 72
          hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet
          with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scoop 6 3½-ounce mounds of dough (the size of generous golf balls)
          onto baking sheet, making sure to turn horizontally any chocolate
          pieces that are poking up; it will make for a more attractive cookie.
          Sprinkle lightly with sea salt and bake until golden brown but still
          soft, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer sheet to a wire rack for 10 minutes,
          then slip cookies onto another rack to cool a bit more. Repeat with
          remaining dough, or reserve dough, refrigerated, for baking remaining
          batches the next day. Eat warm, with a big napkin.
